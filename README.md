## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify the breed of a dog given an input image. This repository not only includes the machine learning model built using deep learning, but also a simple web interface powered by Flask that allows users to upload dog images and get the predicted breed.

## Model Description

- **Model Architecture**: The model is built using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It has been trained on a dataset containing multiple dog breeds, and it predicts the breed from a given image.
  
### Preprocessing
- Images are resized and normalized before being fed into the model for inference.
  
### Training
- The model was trained using [optimizer, loss function] for [number of epochs] on a dataset with [number of dog breeds].

## Flask Web Application

A simple Flask-based web application is provided to allow users to interact with the model through a browser. Users can upload an image of a dog, and the model will return the predicted breed along with the confidence score.

### Running the Flask App

To start the web application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Users can upload images through the web interface, and the predicted breed will be displayed on the page.

### Flask App Structure

```bash
├── templates/                 # HTML templates for the Flask app
│   └── index.html             # Main page for image upload
├── static/                    # Static files (CSS, JS)
├── app.py                     # Main Flask application
├── model/                     # Folder containing the trained model
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-breed-recognition-flask.git
cd dog-breed-recognition-flask
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage

### Running the Flask App:
To start the Flask app, simply run:
```bash
python app.py
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser, where you can upload an image of a dog and receive the breed prediction.

### Running Inference via Command Line:
If you'd like to run inference directly from the command line:
```bash
python scripts/infer.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
```

### Example:
```bash
python scripts/infer.py --image_path ./dog_images/labrador.jpg
```

## Dataset
